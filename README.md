Fraud Classification using Decision Trees for German Credit Data

- Data Exploration - proportion of Good and Bad cases in the dataset
- Building DT on full training data
- Prune DT using cost complexity pruning, and changing max depth, min split and min bucket
- Using ROC curve and AUC values to find best tree
- Incorpotaing mis-classification costs to assess model performance using lift curves
